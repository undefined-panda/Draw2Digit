# Draw2Digit

Little side project where I slowly build a website with web applications I find cool.

Currently I'm working an a page where the user can draw a number with his mouse to let it be detected by an Ai in the backend. The Ai is a CNN that is trained on the MNIST dataset. 
I'm planning to use the Magic UI library to make the website more visually appealing. But first I need to learn React and Typescript.

To view the website run `app.py` and type 'http://127.0.0.1:5000' in the browser. Keep in mind, it's still in progress. Currently it's really bad.
